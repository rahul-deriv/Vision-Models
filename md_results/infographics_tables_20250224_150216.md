Okay, here is the markdown representation of the table found in the image.

```markdown
## Write the table title here

|                 | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 | Header 5 | Header 6 | Header 7 | Header 8 |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Write your header 1 | 45       | 56       | 4        | 9        | 54       | 90       | 32       | 8        |
| Write your header 2 | 9        | 67       | 78       | 12       | 87       | 14       | **89**       | 45       |
| Write your header 3 | 16       | 89       | 23       | 19       | 20       | 21       | 19       | 23       |
| Write your header 4 | 23       | 45       | 12       | 26       | 87       | 28       | 17       | 54       |
| Write your header 5 | 43       | 6        | 7        | 32       | 45       | 23       | 78       | 66       |
| **TOTAL**       | **136**    | **263**    | **124**    | **98**    | **293**    | **176**    | **235**    | **196**    |
```

**Observations:**

*   I used a standard Markdown table format.
*   The first row has the headers of the table, Header 1, Header 2, ..., Header 8.
*   The first column contains the row descriptions, Write your header 1, Write your header 2, ..., Write your header 5, and TOTAL.
*   The "TOTAL" row is in bold.
*   The value "89" in row "Write your header 2" and Header 7 is in bold, this is because the cell was filled with green.
* The value "12" in row "Write your header 4" and Header 3 was filled with yellow, I did not put it in bold.
* The value "98" in row "TOTAL" and Header 4 was filled with red, I did not put it in bold.
